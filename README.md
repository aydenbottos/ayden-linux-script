# Ayden's Linux Script

Here is Team Mensa's Linux script. Please note that copying verbatim is LEGALLY prohibited, and besides, what's the fun in cheating anyway!

cd Desktop && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aydenbottos/ayden-linux-script/master/script.sh && chmod +x script.sh && sudo -H ./script.sh | tee scriptlog.txt

Press q if a systemctl status log comes up.
