# Ayden's Linux Script

Here is my linux script for CyberTaipan. Note that all changes (except for my own for obvious reasons) must be reviewed and approved by another person for changes to go through. This just makes sure that there are not any typos or mistakes. Please do not create a pull request with your own script or files, this repo is strictly for my script. If you need helping setting up your own repo, feel free to DM me on Slack and I will happily assist you.

cd Desktop && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aydenbottos/ayden-linux-script/master/script.sh && chmod +x script.sh && sudo -H ./script.sh | tee scriptlog.txt

Press q if a systemctl status log comes up.
